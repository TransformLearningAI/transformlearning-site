The hospital 8 miles away just posted 15 open CNA positions on Indeed — they can\'t fill them. A retired faculty member emails you an article about a college in Vermont that\'s transforming into a community-centered learning hub instead of closing. And Dr. Okonkwo forwards you a proposal from three of her faculty colleagues — they want to pilot a weekend "community college within a college" offering non-credit workshops to adults.',
